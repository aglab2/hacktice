# hacktice
hacktice is a practice ROM made for SM64 romhacks. It is written in C and use similar API to decomp so it can be used in both binary and decomp hacks.

# Building
Currently Windows with clang is only supported but Linux should work too although extra steps might be needed.

**Windows:**
* Download [LLVM](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases) + [make](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/downlinks/make-bin-zip.php) + [MSVC](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/features/cplusplus/). I suggest using [cmder](https://cmder.app/) for git & bash.
* Use 'make' to compile the payload to 'Hacktice/data' folder and inject it in 'sr8.z64' for testing.
* [Optional] Use [Simple Armips GUI](https://github.com/DavidSM64/SimpleArmipsGui/releases) to convert binary 'hook.asm' to 'Hacktice/hook.xml' and compile 'hook.asm' to 'sr8.z64'
* For hacktice.exe distribution: open MSVC project 'Hacktice/Hacktice.sln' and compile it.
